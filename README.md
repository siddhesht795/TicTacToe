# TicTacToe
I used <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i> for structuring and designing the webpage and <i>JavaScript</i> for the functionality of the game.<br>
<ul>
    <li>As in a game of <b>Tic Tac Toe</b>, when a player is able to bring three <b>X</b> or <b>O</b> in a row, column or diagonally, the player wins the game.</li>
    <li>When you click on the reset button the previous game is cleared and you can start another game.</li>
</ul>
