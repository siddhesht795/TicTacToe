# TicTacToe
I used HTML CSS for structuring and designing the webpage and <i>JavaScript</i> for the functionality of the game.<br>
As in a game of Tic Tac Toe, when a player is able to bring three X or O in a row, column or diagonally, the player wins the game.<br>
When you click on the reset button the previous game is cleared and you can start another game.
